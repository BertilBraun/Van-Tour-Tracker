# Travel Tales

Travel Tales is a Flutter application designed to help you track your holiday trips using a band. It allows you to create markers at points of interest and automatically calculates the route between these points. At the end of your journey, you can export the routes and images from each day.

## Features

- **Track Your Trip**: Create markers at each location you visit, and the app will calculate the route between these points automatically.
- **Live Location**: Keep track of your current location in real-time, which is useful when you are on the go.
- **Markers**: Customize each marker with a name, description, and pictures. The date and location are set automatically but can be adjusted manually.
- **Daily Routes**: Automatically generate images of the routes you traveled each day.
- **Export**: Compile a detailed description of your holiday, including pictures of the routes and export it to your gallery.
